                            MUST HAVE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Product catalog
    - Can browse all products, seeing some info
    - Can search up products and filter by different specs

-- Product details
    - Every product has its own details page with more info 
        (will probably use BGG API here)

-- Authentification
    - Login/Register
    - Reset password
    - Email confirmation
    - Two types of users - clients and admins
    - Guest users can still browse products and read reviews
    - May use third party software (?)

-- Product Reviews
    - Any logged in user can leave a rating (1 to 5 stars)
         and a review comment that can be seen on the 
         product details page

-- Admin panel
    - CRUD interface for adding, modifying and deleting products

-- Shopping Cart
    - A user can add products to their shopping card

-- Simulated billing
    - A user can "buy" the products in his shopping card and a (fake)
        bill with the purchase info will be emailed to them.
    - May use Stripe for this

-- User personal page
    - A page accessible only to the logged in user, where they can
        see the history of their purchase or modify their account
        settings (contact info etc.)

-- Contact page
    - Any logged in user can contact me via email. Will need to 
        introduce some kind of filter in order to reduce spamming.

                            SHOULD HAVE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    depending on user purchase history (something like "you like
    RPG boardgames? - here are more!", or dlcs for already bought ones)

-- Stock / Out of Stock products
    - An admin can also see the quantity of each product
        that is available for selling
    - An admin can check/uncheck if a product is in stock or not
    - A client can ask for a restock of a certain product on a special
        page - admins will be notified on their dashboards or emails
    
-- Admin Dashboard 
    - Admins gain access to a personal dashboard where they can see
        statistics for products or categories (nr sold, revenue, etc.)
    - They can also moderate comments and ban users

-- Geek Stuff, not just board games
    - the shop will sell minifigures, cards, and other stuff too

    - A page/section for new products and other BG Shop news
